Transitioning an element from a zero height to it's actual height is not possible to do with pure CSS, unless you know the height in advance.

This component automatically sets `max-height`, so that you can style transitions _to that height_.

## Installation

```
ember install @zestia/ember-expander
```

Add the following to `~/.npmrc` to pull @zestia scoped packages from Github instead of NPM.

```
@zestia:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<YOUR_GH_TOKEN>
```

## Demo

## Features

- Fixes ["css transition to height auto"](https://google.com/search?q=css+transition+to+height+auto) ✔︎
- Lazy content ✔︎
- Cancellable transitions ✔︎
- Nested expanders ✔︎

## Notes

- This addon intentionally does not come with any styles.
- It is configured with [ember-test-waiters](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters) so `await`ing in your test suite will just work.

## Example

```handlebars
<Expander as |expander|>
  <expander.Button {{on 'click' expander.toggle}}>
    Toggle
  </expander.Button>
  <expander.Content>
    Hello World
  </expander.Content>
</Expander>
```

## `Expander`

### Arguments

#### `@expanded`

Optional. Expanders are rendered as collapsed by default. Use this argument to manually control their expanded/collapsed state.

#### `@onReady`

Optional. This action exposes an API for full control over an Expander.

#### `@onExpanded`

Optional. This action fires after the content has rendered and the transition to reveal that content has finished.

#### `@onCollapsed`

Optional. This action fires after the transition to hide the content has finished, and the content has been removed from the DOM.

### API

#### `Content`

The area to render the content

#### `contentElement`

The DOM element, when expanded

#### `toggle`

Toggles the expanded/collapsed state

#### `expand`

Expands to reveal the content

#### `collapse`

Collapses the content, and un-renders it

#### `isExpanded`

Whether or not the content is showing

#### `isTransitioning`

Whether or not a transition is in progress to reveal or hide the content.

## Further explanation

### Expanding

When expanding, the component will automatically set the `max-height`. This allows you to use a CSS transition to expand to full height, and reveal the content. `max-height` goes from:

- none (collapsed)
- zero (required to start the transition)
- scroll height (the destination of the transition)
- none (expanded)

The max-height is removed after expansion, this is so that if the contents of your element subsequently changes, the DOM element can still grow or shrink to fit that new content - without cutting it off, or causing an accidental transition.

### Collapsing

When collapsing, the component will automatically set the `max-height`. This allows you to use a CSS transition to collapse to zero, hiding the content. `max-height` goes from:

- none (expanded)
- scroll height (required to start the transition)
- zero (the destination of the transition)
